# Introduction to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
The Accessibility Checker project aims to provide an AI-powered tool for scanning small business websites for accessibility compliance issues. To ensure the quality and reliability of the project, implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines is crucial. This document outlines the approach and tools used to automate code quality checks, ensuring that the deployed site (index.html) becomes a working client-side version of the product.

## Current CI/CD Setup
The existing repository contains two GitHub Actions workflows: `.github/workflows/self-scan.yml` and `.github/workflows/test.yml`. These workflows provide a basic foundation for automating tests and code quality checks. The `self-scan.yml` workflow is designed to scan the repository for accessibility issues, while the `test.yml` workflow runs automated tests.

## Automated Code Quality Checks
To improve engineering efficiency, the following automated code quality checks will be implemented:

1. **Linting**: Integrate ESLint to enforce coding standards and detect potential errors.
2. **Code Formatting**: Use Prettier to ensure consistent code formatting throughout the repository.
3. **Type Checking**: Utilize TypeScript to catch type-related errors and improve code maintainability.
4. **Unit Tests**: Expand the existing test suite to cover more functionality and ensure that individual components work as expected.
5. **Integration Tests**: Implement tests that verify the interactions between different components and ensure that the overall system functions correctly.
6. **Accessibility Audits**: Run automated accessibility audits using tools like Lighthouse or axe-core to identify potential accessibility issues.
7. **Security Audits**: Perform regular security audits using tools like Snyk or npm audit to detect vulnerabilities and ensure the project's security.

## CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline will be designed to automate the following steps:

1. **Build**: Run linting, code formatting, and type checking tools to ensure code quality.
2. **Test**: Execute unit tests, integration tests, and accessibility audits to verify functionality and accessibility.
3. **Security Audit**: Perform security audits to detect vulnerabilities.
4. **Deploy**: Deploy the built and tested code to production, ensuring that the deployed site (index.html) becomes a working client-side version of the product.

## Tools and Integrations
The following tools and integrations will be used to implement the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **GitHub Actions**: Utilize GitHub Actions to automate the CI/CD pipeline.
2. **ESLint**: Integrate ESLint for linting and code quality checks.
3. **Prettier**: Use Prettier for code formatting.
4. **TypeScript**: Utilize TypeScript for type checking.
5. **Jest**: Expand the existing test suite using Jest.
6. **Lighthouse**: Use Lighthouse for accessibility audits.
7. **axe-core**: Integrate axe-core for accessibility audits.
8. **Snyk**: Utilize Snyk for security audits.

## Example Code
The following example code demonstrates how to integrate ESLint and Prettier into the CI/CD pipeline:
```yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Lint code
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Format code
        run: npm run format
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test
      - name: Deploy to production
        uses: gh-pages/deploy@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./build
```
```javascript
// .github/workflows/lint.yml
name: Lint Code

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Lint code
        run: npm run lint
```
```javascript
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "format": "prettier --write .",
  "test": "jest"
}
```
By implementing automated code quality checks and a CI/CD pipeline, the Accessibility Checker project can ensure that the deployed site (index.html) becomes a working client-side version of the product, while maintaining high code quality and reliability.
